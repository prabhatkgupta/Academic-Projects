# Decision Tree Classifier

Build a Dataset classification model using the Decision tree classifier. The model was trained with a dataset from animal kingdom species involving 8 attibutes to describe the properties of a specific one and a class/family to which it belonged

The trained classification model was then used on a test dataset which successfully classified animals to their respective class/family
